======================================

| Total     | Released | Due                         |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 100 points| FIXME    | **FIXME at 11:59 PM ET**    |

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your work to Canvas as a zip file, named `a5_<uniqname>.zip`. Replace `<uniqname>` with your uniqname: e.g. `a5_zhaojer.zip`, note that the angle brackets should NOT be included in your filename. Renaming (e.g., "-1") done by Canvas is fine.

This zip file should have a *single directory* containing *all files and directories* provided in the starter code. In other words, the zip file should have the following structure.

```console
a5_uniqname
├── README.txt (OPTIONAL)
├── img
│   ├── 1.jpg
│   └── 2.jpg
├── index.css
├── index.html
├── loading.gif
└── script.js
```

Not following the upload instruction will result in a penalty.
