======================================

| Total     | Released | Due                         |

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your work to Canvas as a zip file, named `a2_<uniqname>.zip`. Replace `<uniqname>` with your uniqname: e.g. `a2_zhaojer.zip`, note that the angle brackets should NOT be included in your filename. Renaming (e.g., "-1") done by Canvas is fine.

This zip file should have a *single directory* containing *all files and directories* provided in the starter code. In other words, the zip file should have the following structure.

```console
a2_uniqname
├── index.html
├── scripts
│   ├── jquery.min.js
│   └── page.js
├── src
│   ├── asteroid.png
│   ├── frontpage_background.jpg
│   ├── port.gif
│   └── shield.gif
└── style
    └── index.css
```

Not following the upload instruction will result in a penalty.

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is for you to gain practical experience in building a single-page web application with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS (jQuery). Specifically, you will be creating the main menu of a game. No external library or framework, other than jQuery, is allowed.

## Requirements

We outline the requirements for each of the components below. **Everything listed in this section, unless labeled as "Suggested", is required.** The demo video & screenshots may be helpful in understanding the website; however, your website does NOT need to look exactly like them.

### General

- Only use one HTML file, `index.html`. *-10 points off if not followed.*
- Do all styling/layout in a separate CSS file, `index.css`. *-10 points off if not followed.*
    - Remark: `<b>` and `<i>` tags count as inline styling. Do not use them.
    - Moderate use of `<br>` tags are ok.
- Do all JavaScript code in a separate JS file, `page.js`. *-10 points off if not followed.*
    - Registering event listeners for an HTML element inline is ok.
- Use relative paths for images. *-10 points off if not followed.*

### Landing Page (25 points)

#### Main Components

- a background image
- an "Asteroids" header
- two buttons, "Play game!" and "Settings", that transition to the correct corresponding screen when clicked (Need JavaScript)
    - "Play game!" transitions to Tutorials Page
    - "Settings" transitions to the Settings Panel

#### Required

- When you first load the HTML page, the landing page should be shown
- Use the background as it appears from the [screenshot](#landing-page) above
- Header should be at the top and span the entire width of the game window
- The text "Asteroids" should be horizontally centered
- Asteroid gifs should appear on the left and right side of the header; they should also have the same height as the header while retaining their original width/height ratio
    - Hint: [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) ([Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) is a great website to learn about Flexbox)
- Both buttons must appear within the game’s border and be horizontally centered and aligned
- Text in the buttons should be horizontally and vertically centered
- There should be some space between the first button and the bottom of the header, and some space between the two buttons

#### Suggested Style

Header:

```css

### Settings Panel (25 points)

#### Main Components

    - Hint: [How To Create Range Sliders](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) (Need JavaScript)
- The three difficulty buttons
    - have the same size (height/width)
    - are labeled "Easy","Normal", and "Hard" respectively
    - are vertically aligned and evenly spaced horizontally
- There is a distinct border around the difficulty that is currently selected

## FAQ

### Do I need to create additional files other than the ones provided in the starter code?

No. You should write all of your code in `index.html`, `style/index.css`, and `scripts/page.js`.

### What is the recommended development environment for the assignments?

We recommend using any text editor (e.g. VSCode) and directly opening your `index.html` file in Google Chrome to test your code. You do not need any additional extensions (e.g. Live Server).

### What are relative paths vs. absolute paths?

Relative paths begin with the current directory `.`, whereas absolute paths begin with the root directory `/`. Read more in [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/absolute-relative-pathnames-unix/).

### Can I use sample code from W3Schools?

Yes.

### Can I apply additional CSS styling in my game?

Yes! As long as they do not conflict with any of the required styles mentioned in the spec.

### Are we required to use jQuery (e.g. for things like event listeners)?

No, you are not required to use the jQuery library. However, using it will make it much easier to complete this (and the next) assignment.

### Are we allowed to use `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<h1>` tags?

Yes.

### Is it OK if some elements briefly appear and then disappear upon opening `index.html`?

Yes.
