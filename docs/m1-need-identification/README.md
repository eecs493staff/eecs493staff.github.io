EECS 493 Milestone 1: Need Identification
======================================

| Due date | Task / Objective |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Sun 2/2 11:59 PM | User need + break point |

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| [Canvas Assignment]() | Submit M1 here |
| [Example Transcripts]() | Example transcripts |
| [Example Background Information Document]() | Example background Information of interview data document |

### Goals 
- Conduct interviews (6%)
- Interpretation notes (6%)
- Affinity Diagram (6%)
- Written report (2%)

### User Need & Break Point
The goal for this milestone is to identify users’ needs, which will be used to motivate your product design. You will need to conduct your interviews and transcribe them following the format of our [Example Transcripts]() for different project themes, specifically the first one (A1: Improving undergraduate students’ career development experiences) the teaching staff prepared. 

For further inspiration, we have also provided four additional sets of interview questions from previous semesters that cover different themes:
- A2: A business communication platform that simplifies interaction across groups
- A3: Empowering undergraduate students to make informed and affordable sustainable consumer choices
- A4: Mood tracking for undergraduate students
- A5: Gamified study planning app to improve undergraduate students’ productivity

For each theme’s first interview notes (e.g., transcript of P1), the teaching staff has provided comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the question design, which may be helpful when designing your own interview questions.

You need to conduct your own interviews with a minimum of 4 participants (i.e. each team member needs to conduct at least 1 interview), each lasting 20-30 minutes. Then, transcribe, and clean your interview transcripts (you’ll need to submit them).

Based on your transcripts, you need to identify **up to two** user needs and two break points, using the techniques for synthesizing qualitative data from lectures (e.g. affinity diagram). To generate ideas for your final project, we suggest you generate as many notes as possible based on the transcript. For reference, a lower limit is 70+ white notes (for all transcripts), with 18-24 blue notes, 6-12 pink notes, and 3-4 green notes.

You will also need to create a spreadsheet with interpretation notes and a final affinity diagram for this submission. The format and content requirements are similar to the examples discussed in lecture 8 and discussion 4. 

Please also have another document describing the background information, and include brief descriptions of (1) how you conducted interviews, (2) your interview questions, and (3) a demographic table. Please see this [Background Information Document]() for an example. 

### Deliverable
You need to submit the following as one zip file on Canvas.
1. A folder with clean transcripts following the format of the example transcripts.
2. A written report with background information about the interview, brief descriptions of how you conducted interviews, your interview questions, and a demographic table.
3. A spreadsheet with the interpretation notes (e.g., the base layer notes (white notes)).
4. A pdf/image file of the affinity diagram. You can do this on paper+whiteboard (we recommend printing out the notes on paper rather than writing), or on a digital platform like Mural or Miro. Make sure all texts are legible.
    - You need to have at least 70+ white notes, 18-24 blue notes, 6-12 pink notes, and 3-4 green notes
5. An up to 700-word written report of up to two user needs and two break points your team have identified in a .docx.

### Grading Rubric
<!-- TODO: Update Rubric -->

- 6 points: interview data (background, protocol, transcripts)
- 6 points: Interpretation notes.
- 6 points: Affinity diagram.
- 2 points: A written report of up to two user needs and two break points you have identified.
