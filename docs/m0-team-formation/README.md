EECS 493 Milestone 0: Team Formation
======================================

<!-- TODO: Update links and dates before releasing milestone -->

| Due date | Task / Objective |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Sun 2/2 11:59 PM | Team registration form / team finding form |
| Sun 2/2 11:59 PM | Team registration form for assigned teams |

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| [Team Registration Form]() | Register your teams here |
| [Team Finding Form]() | Fill this out, if you would like us to form a team for you |
| [Project Team Spreadsheet]() | A detailed list of all project teams for this semester |

### Deliverable
- Form a team of 4 people
    - If you formed your own team, fill out the [Team Registration Form]().
    - If you would like us to form a team for you, fill out the [Team Finding Form]().
        - We will form teams after the due date. Once you are assigned to a team, you will have 2 days to submit the Team Registration Form.

### Additional Details
- You are welcome to use Piazzaâ€™s search for teammates feature, or try to meet new people in class or discussion!
- You should aim for a team of **4**. A team of 3 will be expected to do the same amount of work as a team of 4. A team of 5 will be expected to do more than a team of 4.
- You might want to just work with your friends, but try to have a diverse range of skills on your team, including designing/drawing, interviewing, and Figma.
- **All members will need to be present in the same lecture section for the Project Showcases and Final Presentation days.** Each student who misses a day will lose 4% on the final project grade for each day missed.
- If you have problems with one of your team members, please call it to our attention, since you will be graded on what you turn in, just like in the real world.

### Choosing a Project Theme

Your team will come up with your own project theme, with the only restriction being that the stakeholder group should be people you can easily have access to, e.g., other undergraduate students. Specifically, in Milestone 0, you will need to
- Submit a proposal for your project theme in the Team Registration form linked above.

In Milestone 1, you will need to
- Conduct your own interviews with a minimum of 4 participants (i.e. each team member needs to conduct at least 1 interview), each lasting 20-30 minutes;
- Transcribe your interviews;
- Clean your interview transcripts and submit them.
