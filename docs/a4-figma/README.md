## Submission Instructions

Please submit a written report to Canvas as a .docx or .doc or .pdf.

Not following the upload instruction will result in a penalty.

## Assignment Objective

The objective of this assignment is to gain practical experience using Figma in developing a high-fidelity prototype and performing a heuristic evaluation of the prototype.

## Grading Breakdown

This assignment has 2 parts:

1. Develop a prototype based on a storyboard using Figma - *45 points*
2. Write a report - *55 points*
    - describing the Figma features you used in your prototype
    - evaluating your prototype using 3 of Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics
    - reflecting on this assignment

## Requirements

We outlined the requirements for each part of the assignment. **Everything listed below, unless labeled as "Suggested", is required.** Bullet points under "Suggested" will not be graded.

### Figma Prototype

This section describes the specific Figma requirements that your prototype must meet.

#### Mobile

The prototype should be designed for mobile devices. You may choose any mobile frame (e.g. iPhone 15, Google Pixel 6, etc.) you like to use in your prototype.

#### Frames

The prototype should have the following 6 frames.

**Frame 1**

- Dsplaying a list of (new) quests (i.e. quest names).
- The quests have to be written using meaningful texts instead of placeholders like "Lorem ipsum".
- Example Quest Name: "Art at UMMA."
- Hint: Try using components and auto-layout.
- After clicking on one (and only one) of the quests, it should navigate to Frame 2.

**Frame 2**

- Displaying one quest in detail, including
    - a concise description of the quest
    - a map with
        - a route to the quest's location (from the user's current location)
        - distance/ETA
    - buttons to accept and decline the quest
- Example Quest Description: "Go to UMMA and take 3 pictures of art pieces you liked!"
- After declining the quest, it should navigate back to Frame 1.
- After accepting the quest, it should navigate to Frame 3.
- Remark: the "map" can simply be a static image.

**Frame 3**

- Displaying the current quest in detail, including
    - a map with
        - a route to the destination
        - distance/ETA
    - a button to open the camera
    - a button to mark the quest as complete
- After clicking on the "mark the quest as complete" button (or something similar), it should navigate to Frame 4.

**Frame 4**

- Displaying a message asking the user to confirm whether they have truly completed the quest.
- Hint: This frame can simply be a pop-up that gets displayed over Frame 3. Try using Figma's "Open Overlay" feature.
- After the user confirms that the quest is truly completed, it should navigate to Frame 5.

**Frame 5**

- Displaying "Quest Completed!" and a "reward" given to the user.
- The user has to somehow be able to navigate to Frame 6.

**Frame 6**

- For user to add a completed quest to their "Favorites".
- The user must be able to interact with some elements of the frame and then it should provide at least 1 clear feedback that the quest is now added to their "Favorites".
- Example: User clicks on a black "heart" icon next to a completed quest -> "heart" changes to red or a piece of text gets displayed briefly saying "Added to favorites".
- Hint: Use an Interactive Component.
- The user has to be able to navigate back to either Frame 1 or Frame 2* depending on your design of this frame.
