## Submission Instructions

Please submit a written report to Canvas as a .docx or .doc or .pdf.

Not following the upload instruction will result in a penalty.

## Assignment Objective

The objective of this assignment is to gain practical experience using Figma in developing a high-fidelity prototype and performing a heuristic evaluation of the prototype.

## Grading Breakdown

This assignment has 2 parts:

1. Develop a prototype based on a storyboard using Figma - *45 points*
2. Write a report - *55 points*
    - describing the Figma features you used in your prototype
    - evaluating your prototype using 3 of Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics
    - reflecting on this assignment

## Helpful Resources

1. Figma Lecture recording/slides on Canvas
