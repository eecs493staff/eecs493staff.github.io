## Requirements

We outlined the requirements for each part of the assignment. **Everything listed below, unless labeled as "Suggested", is required.** Bullet points under "Suggested" will not be graded.

### Figma Prototype

This section describes the specific Figma requirements that your prototype must meet.

#### Mobile

The prototype should be designed for mobile devices. You may choose any mobile frame (e.g. iPhone 15, Google Pixel 6, etc.) you like to use in your prototype.

#### Figma Features

Other than the basic features like frames, texts, and shapes, which you have to use by default, you *must* also use the following Figma features at least once in your prototype:

1. Auto Layout
2. Constraints
3. Components
4. Prototyping (interactivity)
5. Interactive Components

#### Micro-Interaction

There should be an instance of micro-interaction present in the prototype. Read [this article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microinteractions/) for some examples. Be creative!

Remark: This micro-interaction should be different from the "add to favorites" in Frame 6.

#### Style
All frames should have appropriate & good style. Does not have to be complex; you just need to show that you have put in the effort in designing these frames.

#### Frames

The prototype should have the following 6 top-level frames.

**Frame 1**

- Dsplaying a list of (new) quests (i.e. quest names).
- The quests have to be written using meaningful texts instead of placeholders like "Lorem ipsum".
- Example Quest Name: "Art at UMMA."
- Hint: Try using components and auto-layout.
- After clicking on one (and only one) of the quests, it should navigate to Frame 2.

**Frame 2**

- Displaying one quest in detail, including
    - a concise description of the quest
    - a map with
        - a route to the quest's location (from the user's current location)
        - distance/ETA
    - buttons to accept and decline the quest
- Example Quest Description: "Go to UMMA and take 3 pictures of art pieces you liked!"
- After declining the quest, it should navigate back to Frame 1.
- After accepting the quest, it should navigate to Frame 3.
- Remark: the "map" can simply be a static image.

**Frame 3**

- Displaying the current quest in detail, including
    - a map with
        - a route to the destination
        - distance/ETA
    - a button to open the camera
    - a button to mark the quest as complete
- After clicking on the "mark the quest as complete" button (or something similar), it should navigate to Frame 4.

**Frame 4**

- Displaying a message asking the user to confirm whether they have truly completed the quest.
- Hint: This frame can simply be a pop-up that gets displayed over Frame 3. Try using Figma's "Open Overlay" feature.
- After the user confirms that the quest is truly completed, it should navigate to Frame 5.

**Frame 5**

- Displaying "Quest Completed!" and a "reward" given to the user.
- The user has to somehow be able to navigate to Frame 6.

**Frame 6**

- For user to add a completed quest to their "Favorites".
- The user must be able to interact with some elements of the frame and then it should provide at least 1 clear feedback that the quest is now added to their "Favorites".
- Example: User clicks on a black "heart" icon next to a completed quest -> "heart" changes to red or a piece of text gets displayed briefly saying "Added to favorites".
- Hint: Use an Interactive Component.
- The user has to be able to navigate back to either Frame 1 or Frame 2* depending on your design of this frame.
    - *This should technically be an "Alternate Version of Frame 1 or Frame 2" since a quest has just been completed by the user at this point in time. But for simplicity, you do not have to make a different version for Frame 1 or Frame 2.

#### Suggested

- Add more elements to any frame to get better usability.
    - e.g. a button to cancel the current quest
- Add more frames if you believe it can better demonstrate how a user navigates through your prototype.
- Explore additional Figma features in your prototype.

### Written Report

This section describes the specific requirements of the report, which has 3 main parts.

#### Figma Link

At the very beginning of the report (document), include a link to your Figma prototype with access type "can view".

<img src="images/share.gif" width="40%" />

Please make sure the link is working properly by opening it in an incognito/private window, and that clicking on the "Present" button will present your prototype which the user can interact with by clicking on certain elements on each frame.

Failing to do so will result in a 20% grade deduction.

#### Length & Organization

The report should be short and concise; it should not be longer than 700 words. Points will be deducted if your report is longer than 700 words.

Please use headings/subheadings to better organize your report.

#### Part 1

Briefly describe how you've used the 5 required Figma features in your prototype and what is the micro-interaction you created in your prototype.

- The 5 required features are listed in the [Figma Prototype](#required-figma-features) section.
- For each feature, simply describe 1 example of what you used it for in 1 or 2 sentences; same applies for the micro-interaction.
    - e.g. I used the "auto layout" feature in Frame #1 to vertically stack the quests on top of each other.
    - Suggested: Include a screenshot corresponding to your written description.

#### Part 2

Evaluate your prototype using **3** of Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.

For each heuristic you chose, provide 2 examples in your prototype along with their screenshots to briefly explain how they meet or don't meet the heuristic.

- i.e. For each example, you need to submit a screenshot and provide a short description.
- Please use the following template to structure each of your heuristic/example:
    - Heuristic Rule: 
    - Example 1 screenshot:
    - Example 1 description:
        - e.g. what the user might be doing in this screenshot
    - Does it support or violate the heuristic?
    - Reason:

Here are the 10 usability heuristics for your reference:

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

#### Part 3

Provide feedback on this assignment.

Briefly describe:

- What you liked about this assignment.
- What you did not like about this assignment & what we can do to improve it.

## FAQ

### I want to add some creativity to my design, making it slightly different from the spec, is this OK?

Yes, as long as all elements mentioned in the spec still exist in your design. If your design is too different from the spec, then please clearly indicate these differences either in your written report or as a comment on Canvas so graders can easily know where to look.

### What is the difference between microinteractions vs. interactive components?

Microinteraction is a design concept, which describes the minor yet important interactions that enhance user experiences and improves usability.

For instance, a button changing color being pressed, an animated progress bar showing the status of the machine. On the other hand, an interactive component is a feature of Figma. You can use this feature to implement a microinteraction in Figma.

You can implement whatever microinteraction you would like as long as you clearly describe it in your report.
