# EECS 493 Final Project Spec

# Project Overview

Throughout the semester, you’ll be working together on a team project that follows the user-centered design process. This project makes up 25% of your total course grade. You will submit milestones at different stages of the project, and the detailed timeline is provided below.

## Project Theme

Your team will come up with your own project theme, with the only restriction being that the stakeholder group should be people you can easily have access to, e.g., other undergraduate students. You can find a list of final project examples below.

## Detailed Timeline

  - If you formed your own team, fill out this [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8).
  - If you would like us to form a team for you, fill out this [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6). - We will form teams for you _after_ the due date; after you are assigned to a team, your team will have 2 days to submit the Team Registration form.
  <!-- - [Link to Project Team Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiBZJ0HrOh0kTuRdP52OXtMO5anVlp9M1FgPJECg9Ho/edit?usp=sharing). -->

### Team Membership

Teams should ideally consist of **4** members.

- If you select your own team:
  - You need to submit a list of team members via the [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8).
  - _Please only submit 1 form per team._
- If you choose to have us assign you to a team.
  - You have to fill out a [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6) describing yourself, e.g. strengths, time available to work, etc.
  - Please note that if you choose this option, you will be assigned to a team _after the due date_, and your team will have **2 days** to submit the Team Registration form, i.e. slightly behind on the project.

### Additional Notes for Team Formations

- _You are welcome to use Piazza’s search for teammates feature, or try to meet new people in class or discussion\!_
- You should aim for a team of **4**. A team of 3 will be expected to do the _same_ amount of work as a team of 4\. A team of 5 will be expected to take on _additional work_\.
- Aim for diverse skills (e.g., design/drawing, interviewing, Figma).
- **_All members must be present for the Storyboard Showcase, Prototype Showcase, and Final Presentation._** Absent member(s) will receive a 4% deduction from the final project grade for each absence.
- If conflicts with team members arise, notify the staff promptly. Grading will be based on deliverables as a group.

### Choosing a Project Theme

- Propose your project theme in the Team Registration form.
- The only requirement: your stakeholder group must be accessible to you (e.g., other undergraduate students).

## Milestone 1

### Deliverables

Submit the following **as one zip file on Canvas**.

1. A folder with clean transcripts following the format of [the example transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AsWH_iViz05R_HTR-6t6ROWJ6OVaDhN?usp=sharing). There should be two transcripts per team member.
2. A spreadsheet with 70+ interpretation / white notes.
3. A pdf/image file of the affinity diagram. You can do this on paper + whiteboard (we recommend printing out the notes on paper rather than writing), or on a digital platform like Mural or Miro. Make sure all texts are legible. You need to have at least 70+ white notes, 18-24 blue notes, 6-12 pink notes, and 3-4 green notes.
4. Interview Background and Design Document: A document with background information about the interview (including procedure, goals, and context), interview questions, and a demographic table of participants.
5. Written Report: An up to 700-word written report of up to two user needs and two break points your team have identified in a .docx.

### Overview: User Need & Break Point Discovery

The goal for this milestone is to identify authentic user needs that will drive your product design. You'll conduct your own interviews and transcribe them following the format of [our provided example transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AsWH_iViz05R_HTR-6t6ROWJ6OVaDhN?usp=sharing), particularly the primary example (A1: Improving undergraduate students' career development experiences) that the teaching staff has carefully annotated.

For additional guidance, we've provided four more sets of interview questions from previous semesters covering diverse themes:

1. A2: A business communication platform that simplifies interaction across groups
2. A3: Empowering undergraduate students to make informed and affordable sustainable consumer choices
3. A4: Mood tracking for undergraduate students
4. A5: Gamified study planning app to improve undergraduate students’ productivity

For each theme's first interview transcript (P1), the teaching staff has annotated strengths and weaknesses in the question design, which should help you craft your own interview questions.

### Interview Requirements

Each team member should conduct at least 2 interviews, with each session lasting 20-30 minutes. After conducting interviews, transcribe and clean your transcripts for submission.

### Analysis Process

Based on your transcripts, identify **_up to two_** user needs and two break points, using the techniques for synthesizing qualitative data from lectures (e.g. affinity diagram). To generate robust insights for your final project, aim to create as many notes as possible from the transcripts. The minimum requirements are:

- 70+ white notes
- 18-24 blue notes
- 6-12 pink notes
- 3-4 green notes

You'll also create a spreadsheet with interpretation notes and a final affinity diagram for this submission. The format and content should follow the examples from lecture 8 and discussion 4. We've provided student submissions from previous semesters for each of the 5 projects listed above in the folder: [\[SHARED\] Example Transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AsWH_iViz05R_HTR-6t6ROWJ6OVaDhN). Each example includes instructor comments highlighting areas for improvement.

Additionally, prepare a document with (1) background information, (2) how you conducted interviews, (3) your interview questions, and (4) a participant demographic table. Refer to this document [Example Interview Background and Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZtlWHEsu2YXwLK51_aheKRxTHcse4lA2AVYnUC3Ew0/edit) for an example.

### Grading Rubric

You will be graded on:

- 70 Interpretation notes well distributed among participants (3 pts)
- Quality of interpretation notes (3 pts)
- Quantity of blue, pink, and green notes (3 pts)
- Quality of blue, pink, and green notes (3 pts)
- Written Report (2 pts)
- Interview Design Document (6 pts)

<!-- ### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2

Once you've identified user needs and break points, you'll move into the ideation phase where you'll brainstorm solutions using IDEO methods, create storyboards to visualize your concepts, and validate them through speed dating sessions with users. -->

### Goals

- Ideation (8%)

  - Brainstorm as many solutions as you can using the IDEO Ideation method taught in class among your team.
  - Based on these ideas, group and filter them down to a subset of 8-10 ideas that will be used for creating your storyboards.

- In-class Project Showcase (4%)

  - In your class on Friday 10/17, we will host an in-class storyboard session to help you ideate better. We will organize the class to facilitate in-class feedback for our project by fellow students.
  - Please complete the “In-Class Project Showcase Sign-up Form” by NOON, 10/16 (Thursday).

- Speed dating (8%)

  - Speed date the storyboards with at least 4 potential users in order to
    - Validate the user need
    - Get feedback on the proposed solutions
    - Figure out the final design you want to implement in the next step
  - Link to Assignment: Canvas Assignment Link
  - Due Date: Fri 10/17, before class.

- Deliverables: You need to submit the following as one zip file on Canvas.
  - A PDF of a list of at least 80 ideas your team came up with using the IDEO ideation method, and also a subset of 8-10 ideas your team picked for storyboarding.
  - A PDF including all of your storyboards.
  - A PDF/image of the post-it notes you collected during in-class project showcase.
  - Transcripts or notes for at least 4 speed dating sessions (please do not submit the original recordings).
  - A written report of your method, findings, and final design idea (~700 words, not strict)

### Ideation

In the ideation step, you need to first brainstorm at least 80 ideas/solutions to the
user need(s) you identified in Milestone 1. And then, you need to pick 8-10 ideas to
be ferreted out using the storyboards. These ideas can cover one of the identified
user needs or both. This is to say, you can probe storyboards for two different
user needs as a way to validate which one is more relatable to target users. These storyboards
should help you present your ideas visually, without any specific UI designs/implementations.

Here is a rough template (please see lecture for more examples):

- Scenario with a persona (illustrate the user need): 1 panel
- Solution (illustrate how the user need is resolved): 1-2 panels
- Outcome (illustrate the result of the resolution): 1 panel
- For each storyboard, you also need to write two leading questions which show what question you will ask during the speed dating session. (see lecture for examples)

You will present these storyboards for speed dating and in the in-class project showcase. For Canvas submission, take a screenshot/picture of your storyboards and put them into one document.

### Speed Dating

Then, you need to make sure that the user need you have identified is real and narrow down your solutions. You will perform speed dating with at least 4 potential users, analyze the results, and write a brief report.

Assuming you have 8-10 storyboards, each speed dating session should take less than 30 minutes, during which you should present all of your 8-10 storyboards. We encourage each team member to perform one speed dating session and you will then come together to synthesize the results.

#### Speed Dating Procedure

- Speed date with at least 4 potential users using the storyboards you have created.
  - You are responsible for finding your participants.
  - Each team member needs to perform at least one speed dating session.
  - The speed dating session can be done in person or over Zoom (where you can share your screen).
- You will present each storyboard, explain what’s happening.
- Here are some suggestions of questions that you can ask the participants:
  - **Need validation**
    - Have you been in a similar situation before?
    - Does the scenario reflect an authentic situation you’ve been in before?
  - **Attitudes towards solution**
    - Can you share your thoughts on the solution proposed?
    - What aspects of the technology/solution do you find compelling?
    - What are your concerns about the solution proposed?
    - Would you use this technology in your own [specific context, e.g., business, work, project]?
    - How can this technology/solution be made more suitable for your context?
    - Include your solution-specific questions.
- Please note that the above are suggestions. You can use your own questions. In the
  final report, you need to include at least one question for need validation, and at least
  one question to gather thoughts on the solution. Feel free to re-use the options above.
- If the participant consents, recording the session is encouraged. Please then use
  transcription services such as Zoom Cloud Recording to get the transcript, and modify it
  when necessary.
- If the participant does not consent, please take deliberate notes throughout the session.
- You should clean up the transcripts before submitting to us. Please follow the format as
  the previous transcripts we've provided in A2 and Milestone 1. Please do not upload the
  recordings themselves.

#### Analyzing Data from Speed Dating and Presenting your Findings

- Summarize your findings from the 4 speed dating sessions.
- You can use a method of your choice, such as affinity diagramming.
- Specifically, your goal is to answer the questions including:
  - Is the user need real?
  - Why is this an important problem to solve?
  - What challenges do people face in similar situations?
  - What design solution do you converge on for the next step based on the speed dating findings?

### In-Class Project Showcase

The class on 10/17 will be devoted to live critiques, and in short rounds (e.g. ~20 minutes for each round), several teams at a time will post their storyboards on the wall or lay them out on tables around the room. We assume many teams haven’t started running the speed dating sessions yet. Please use this as an opportunity to get feedback to improve your storyboards.

**Make sure to bring your printed storyboards for this showcase!**

Please complete the “Storyboard Session Sign-up Form” linked under “Goals” heading BY NOON ON 10/16.

#### Here's what will happen at the in-class storyboard session:

- There will be a list of team assignments for each round.
- For each round:
  - **If you are presenting your team's storyboard in that round:**
    - Post all pages of your storyboard at the station.
