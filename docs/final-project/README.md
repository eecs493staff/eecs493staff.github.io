# EECS 493 Final Project Spec

# Project Overview

Throughout the semester, you’ll be working together on a team project that follows the user-centered design process. This project makes up 25% of your total course grade. You will submit milestones at different stages of the project, and the detailed timeline is provided below.

## Project Theme

Your team will come up with your own project theme, with the only restriction being that the stakeholder group should be people you can easily have access to, e.g., other undergraduate students. You can find a list of final project examples below.

## Detailed Timeline

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Sun 9/21 11:59 PM | Team registration form / team finding form |
| Sun 9/21 11:59 PM | Team registration form for assigned teams  |

| Resource                                                      | Description                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Team Registration Form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8) | Register your teams here                                   |
| [Team Finding Form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6)      | Fill this out, if you would like us to form a team for you |
| [Project Team Spreadsheet (Te be released)]()                 | A detailed list of all project teams for this semester     |

### Goals

- Form a team of 4 members (either self-selected or assigned by the course staff).
  - If you formed your own team, fill out this [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8).
  - If you would like us to form a team for you, fill out this [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6).
    - We will form teams for you _after_ the due date; after you are assigned to a team, your team will have 2 days to submit the Team Registration form.
- Due Date: **Sunday, September 21**, 11:59 PM
<!-- - [Link to Project Team Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiBZJ0HrOh0kTuRdP52OXtMO5anVlp9M1FgPJECg9Ho/edit?usp=sharing). -->

### Team Membership

Teams should ideally consist of **4** members.

- If you select your own team:
  - You need to submit a list of team members via the [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8).
  - _Please only submit 1 form per team._
- If you choose to have us assign you to a team.
  - You have to fill out a [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6) describing yourself, e.g. strengths, time available to work, etc.
  - Please note that if you choose this option, you will be assigned to a team _after the due date_, and your team will have **2 days** to submit the Team Registration form, i.e. slightly behind on the project.

### Additional Notes for Team Formations

- _You are welcome to use Piazza’s search for teammates feature, or try to meet new people in class or discussion\!_
- You should aim for a team of **4**. A team of 3 will be expected to do the _same_ amount of work as a team of 4\. A team of 5 will be expected to take on _additional work_\.
- Aim for diverse skills (e.g., design/drawing, interviewing, Figma).
- **_All members must be present for the Storyboard Bake-Off, Prototype Bake-Off, and Final Presentation._** Absent member(s) will receive a 4% deduction from the final project grade for each absence.
- If conflicts with team members arise, notify the staff promptly. Grading will be based on deliverables as a group.

### Choosing a Project Theme

- Propose your project theme in the Team Registration form.
- The only requirement: your stakeholder group must be accessible to you (e.g., other undergraduate students).

### Milestone 1 Preview

The goal of Milestone 1 (20% of your final project grade; 5% of your total grade) is to identify users’ needs that will guide and motivate your product design. As part of your Milestone 1 deliverables, you will:

- Conduct interviews with at least 4 participants total (each team member must conduct at least one interview), lasting 20–30 minutes each.
- Transcribe all interviews.
- Clean and format the transcripts according to the provided guidelines, and submit them.

## Milestone 1

<!-- (Worth 20% of final project grade, 5% of total grade)

### Goals

- Conduct interviews (6%)
- Interpretation notes (6%)
- Affinity Diagram (6%)
- Written report (2%)
  - Link to Milestone on Canvas
  - Due Date: Sunday, October 5, 11:59 PM

### User need & Break point

The goal for this milestone is to identify users’ needs, which will be used to motivate your product design. You will need to conduct your interviews and transcribe them following the format of [our example transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AsWH_iViz05R_HTR-6t6ROWJ6OVaDhN?usp=sharing) for different project themes, specifically the first one (A1: Improving undergraduate students’ career development experiences) the teaching staff prepared.

For further inspiration, we have also provided four additional sets of interview questions from previous semesters that cover different themes:

1. A2: A business communication platform that simplifies interaction across groups
2. A3: Empowering undergraduate students to make informed and affordable sustainable consumer choices
3. A4: Mood tracking for undergraduate students
4. A5: Gamified study planning app to improve undergraduate students’ productivity

For each theme’s first interview notes (e.g., transcript of P1), the teaching staff has provided comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the question design, which may be helpful when designing your own interview questions.

You need to conduct your own interviews with a minimum of 4 participants (i.e. each team member needs to conduct at least 1 interview), each lasting 20-30 minutes. Then, transcribe, and clean your interview transcripts (you’ll need to submit them).

Based on your transcripts, you need to identify **_up to two_** user needs and two break points, using the techniques for synthesizing qualitative data from lectures (e.g. affinity diagram). To generate ideas for your final project, we suggest you generate as many notes as possible based on the transcript. For reference, a lower limit is 70+ white notes (for all transcripts), with 18-24 blue notes, 6-12 pink notes, and 3-4 green notes.

You will also need to create a spreadsheet with interpretation notes and a final affinity diagram for this submission. The format and content requirements are similar to the examples discussed in lecture 8 and discussion 4\. As some examples, we have provided student submissions from previous semesters for each of the 5 projects listed above in this folder [\[SHARED\] Example Transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AsWH_iViz05R_HTR-6t6ROWJ6OVaDhN). Notice that each example has its strengths and weaknesses. We have left some comments in these files on how to further improve their quality.

Please also have another document describing the background information, and include brief descriptions of (1) how you conducted interviews, (2) your interview questions, and (3) a demographic table. Please see this document [Background Information of the Interview Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZtlWHEsu2YXwLK51_aheKRxTHcse4lA2AVYnUC3Ew0/edit) for an example.

You need to submit the following **as one zip file on Canvas**.

1. A folder with clean transcripts following the format of [the example transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AsWH_iViz05R_HTR-6t6ROWJ6OVaDhN?usp=sharing).
2. A written report with background information about the interview, brief descriptions of how you conducted interviews, your interview questions, and a demographic table.
3. A spreadsheet with the interpretation notes (e.g., the base layer notes (white notes)).
4. A pdf/image file of the affinity diagram. You can do this on paper+whiteboard (we recommend printing out the notes on paper rather than writing), or on a digital platform like Mural or Miro. Make sure all texts are legible.
   - You need to have at least 70+ white notes, 18-24 blue notes, 6-12 pink notes, and 3-4 green notes
5. An up to 700-word written report of up to two user needs and two break points your team have identified in a .docx.

Grading Rubric

- 6 points: interview data (background, protocol, transcripts)
- 6 points: Interpretation notes.
- 6 points: Affinity diagram.
- 2 points: A written report of up to two user needs and two break points you have identified. -->
