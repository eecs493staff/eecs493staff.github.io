## Milestone 0: Team Formation (Due 9/21)

### Goals

- Form a team of 4 members (either self-selected or assigned by the course staff).
  - If you formed your own team, fill out this [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8).
  - If you would like us to form a team for you, fill out this [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6).
    - We will form teams for you _after_ the due date; after you are assigned to a team, your team will have 2 days to submit the Team Registration form.
- Due Date: **Sunday, September 21**, 11:59 PM
<!-- - [Link to Project Team Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiBZJ0HrOh0kTuRdP52OXtMO5anVlp9M1FgPJECg9Ho/edit?usp=sharing). -->

### Team Membership

Teams should ideally consist of **4** members.

- If you select your own team:
  - You need to submit a list of team members via the [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/x9itCsb9UCqgsbfk8).
  - _Please only submit 1 form per team._
- If you choose to have us assign you to a team.
  - You have to fill out a [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/5G7CpkLgL7JjW1rR6) describing yourself, e.g. strengths, time available to work, etc.
  - Please note that if you choose this option, you will be assigned to a team _after the due date_, and your team will have **2 days** to submit the Team Registration form, i.e. slightly behind on the project.

### Additional Notes for Team Formations

- _You are welcome to use Piazzaâ€™s search for teammates feature, or try to meet new people in class or discussion\!_
- You should aim for a team of **4**. A team of 3 will be expected to do the _same_ amount of work as a team of 4\. A team of 5 will be expected to take on _additional work_\.
- Aim for diverse skills (e.g., design/drawing, interviewing, Figma).
- **_All members must be present for the Storyboard Bake-Off, Prototype Bake-Off, and Final Presentation._** Absent member(s) will receive a 4% deduction from the final project grade for each absence.
- If conflicts with team members arise, notify the staff promptly. Grading will be based on deliverables as a group.
