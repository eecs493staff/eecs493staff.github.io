## Milestone 0: Team Formation

### Goals

- Form a team of 4 people by yourself or by us
  - If you formed your own team, fill out this [Team Registration form](https://forms.gle/Az8TPN3vzLB3Sf7o9).
  - If you would like us to form a team for you, fill out this [Team Finding form](https://forms.gle/7AuQm9qX56WBhVbB6).
    - We will form teams for you _after_ the due date; after you are assigned to a team, your team will have 2 days to submit the Team Registration form.
- Due Date: **Sunday, September 21**, 11:59 PM
- [Link to Project Team Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiBZJ0HrOh0kTuRdP52OXtMO5anVlp9M1FgPJECg9Ho/edit?usp=sharing).

### Team Membership

You should form **a team of 4** people. You may choose to either (exclusive or):

- Pick your own team.
  - You need to submit a list of team members via the form linked above.
  - _Please only submit 1 form per team._
- Have us form a team for you.
  - You have to fill out a form (linked above) describing yourself, e.g. strengths, time available to work, etc.
  - Please note that if you choose this option, you will be assigned to a team _after the due date_, and your team will have **2 days** to submit the Team Registration form, i.e. slightly behind on the project.

### Additional Details

- _You are welcome to use Piazzaâ€™s search for teammates feature, or try to meet new people in class or discussion\!_
- You should aim for a team of **4**. A team of 3 will be expected to do the _same_ amount of work as a team of 4\. A team of 5 will be expected to do _more than_ a team of 4\.
- You might want to just work with your friends, but try to have a diverse range of skills on your team, including designing/drawing, interviewing, and Figma.
- **_All members will need to be present in the same lecture section for the Storyboard Bake-Off, Prototype Bake-Off, and Final Presentation days._** Each student who misses a day will lose 4% on the final project grade for each day missed.
- If you have problems with one of your team members, please call it to our attention, since you will be graded on what you turn in, just like in the real world.
