EECS 493 Course Website
=============

The website is hosted by GitHub Pages from the `/docs/` directory in `master` branch, containing the course homepage (in `eecs493.org/`), and the assignment specs and starter code (in directories with prefix `a`).

The course homepage was adapted from eecs485.org. The specs were written using primer spec.

## Contributing
To update the website, modify the files in `/docs/eecs493.org/` in `master` branch and push to GitHub.

Here are a list of things that need to be updated each semester (might not be comprehensive):

1. Links to course resources (e.g. Gradescope, Canvas, Piazza, etc.)
2. Dates/Times (of lectures, office hours, due dates, etc.)
3. Course schedule
4. Course Google Calendar link
5. People section

## TODO
Write spec & create starter code for each assignment.
