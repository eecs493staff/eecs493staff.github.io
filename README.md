EECS 493 Course Website
=============

The website is hosted by GitHub Pages from the `/docs/` directory in the `master` branch, containing the course homepage website (in `eecs493.org/`), and the assignment specs and starter code (in directories with prefix `a`).

The course homepage was adapted from eecs485.org. The specs were written using primer spec.

### Course Website

To update the course website, modify the files in `/docs/eecs493.org/` in `master` branch and push to GitHub.

Here are a list of things that need to be updated each semester for the course website (might not be comprehensive):

1. Links to course resources (e.g. Gradescope, Canvas, Piazza, etc.)
2. Dates/Times (of lectures, office hours, due dates, etc.)
3. Course schedule
4. Course Google Calendar link
5. People section

### Assignment Spec and Starter Code

To update the assignment spec, modify the markdown file in each of the assignment directories (e.g., `/docs/a2-asteroids-menu/`).

Do NOT directly modify the starter code in this repo; please see each assignment's own repos for more instructions.

## Future TODOs

- Write spec & create starter code for each assignment (A4 and A5 left).
- As we approach the start of the semester, document a comprehensive list of things that need to be updated.
- Consider upgrading to GitHub Team: this allows hosting websites from prviate github repos.
