EECS 493 Course Website
=============

The website is hosted by GitHub Pages from the `/docs/` directory in the `master` branch, containing the course homepage website (in `eecs493.org/`), and the assignment specs and starter code (in directories with prefix `a`).

The course homepage was adapted from eecs485.org. The specs were written using primer spec.

### Assignment Spec and Starter Code

To update the assignment spec, modify the markdown file in each of the assignment directories (e.g., `/docs/a2-asteroids-menu/`).

Do NOT directly modify the starter code in this repo; please see each assignment's own repos for more instructions.

## Future TODOs

- Upgrade to GitHub Teams to host course website from a private repo - [#2](https://github.com/eecs493staff/eecs493staff.github.io/issues/2)
    - Can also encapsulate each assignment spec into its own website by moving them to their respective private repos
- Improve GitHub Pages config to fix Google search result issue - [#3](https://github.com/eecs493staff/eecs493staff.github.io/issues/3)
